## General Information
- This project intends to solve the problem of <b>cusotmer churn</b> by prediciting customers who are likely churn.
- Predicitions are made using Machine Learning techniques for Classification.
- The model is trained on data from <b>10k</b> credit card users with <b>18</b> features.
- This project is part of a course on Machine Learning Operations.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.7

## Features
- Predict which of your customer may churn
- Know the reasons for churn with Global and Local Model Explainability
- Data Drift Report and Model Scorecard


## Screenshots

## Setup
The requirements are specified in the [requirement.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apollo-robin/customer-churn/main/Python%20Files/requirements.txt) file in Python Files directory.


## Usage
The easier way to use the model is to go to the Web Interface. Secondly all the Notebooks can be opened directly in Google Colaboratory. Make sure to upload the required data files (.csv/.pkl) or models (.pkl) on Colab runtime.


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_
